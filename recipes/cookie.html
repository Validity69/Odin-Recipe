    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Cookies are sweet, baked treats made from a dough of flour, sugar, butter, and other ingredients like chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruits. They come in various textures, from soft and chewy to crisp and crunchy, depending on the recipe and baking method. Originating from Persia, cookies have evolved into countless variations worldwide, including classics like chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and shortbread. Their versatility makes them a beloved snack for all ages, perfect for pairing with milk, coffee, or tea.
        Beyond their taste, cookies hold cultural and emotional significance, often tied to traditions, celebrations, and homemade comfort. They are popular during holidays like Christmas, where families bake and decorate them together, creating cherished memories. With the rise of artisanal and gourmet baking, cookies continue to evolve, incorporating unique flavors and ingredients such as matcha, sea salt caramel, and even plant-based alternatives. Whether store-bought or homemade, cookies remain an enduring symbol of simple joy and indulgence.</p>
